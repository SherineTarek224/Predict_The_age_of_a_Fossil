# Predict_The_age_of_a_Fossil
## It's a regression problem to get the age of fossil using it's feature.
  a nalysis fossil notebook includes Exploratory Data analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing and Machine learning model to 
  predict the age of fossil. Slide show contains the inshits of the analysis of data. 
## EDA
  By Asking various Queation and using charts and plots like pie plot, countplot,...etc to answer them, we could expore 
  the dataset well and get the relation among the features.
## Data Preprocessing:
    Drop Duplicated Values.
    1. Drop null Values.
    2.Drop Duplicated Values.
    3.Handling Categorical Features: By using  label encoding and other techniques, we could convert the categorical 
        data to numerical one. this step make it easier to building the model.
 ## Machine learning model
    Apply a linear regression model to predict the age of the fossils by its features
